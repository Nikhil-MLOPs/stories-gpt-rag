Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a curious child who loved stories.
Every evening, the child would sit under an old tree and imagine new worlds: dragons,
mysterious forests, and distant galaxies. The stories were not written anywhere;
they only lived in the child's mind, changing a little each day.

One day, the child decided to start writing the stories down so they would never be lost.
From that day on, every page became a doorway into a different adventure.
